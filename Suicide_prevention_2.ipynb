When I was 5 year old, older kids who were taking care of me were sexually abusing me. My mother laughed it off. \\n2. When I was 13 years old I noted in my diary \"only God can save me.\" Planned to kill myself after I take sacraments at age of 18. I endured constant mental and physical abuse. \\n3. Parents forbade me to seek medical help, because I lived in a small town and this would be a disgrace to the whole family. My morning prayer always said \"Please let me die today.\" Unfortunately once when I got hit by a car I didn\\'t die. \\n4. When I hit age of 18 I could finally seek help on my own. I received meds and I rediscovered the world. That feeling was amazing.\\n5. When I was 20 my (now ex) boyfriend raped me. One of the kids from the point number 1 stalked me for over a year and tried to break into my room. Father laughed it off. I was stupid enough to tell my mother about everything - she commanded me to get back to my ex or else I would need to leave the house. After some weeks of her maniacally laughing at me and telling everybody that I got raped, I left.  \\n6. I\\'ve met my new boyfriend. I offered him the rest of my trust and my ugly heart. He offered his own in exchange. \\n7. All my bosses were really toxic. I spent my days on stabbing my hand with a pen to blood to  endure the mental abuse they served me. I needed money.\\n8. My boyfriend sudenly says he loves me but he needs some space. He consulted it all with his mom beforehand. I feel left out, abandonned. \\n\\nPlease someone kill me already.

While I never wanted to get pregnant I also didn\\'t want to have an abortion. My boyfriend didn\\'t want to be a father. I gave in. I had the abortion. That afternoon, after surgery, my boyfriend and I headed out of town to go to a friends birthday party. As we were headed to the train station we got stuck in traffic and had to get out of the taxi to book it to the station in order to try to make it to the train on time. I could barely walk, but I was tugged along for two blocks. Only for us to miss the train. Only to be blamed for missing the train. Fast forward to that night: I was ignored for the majority of the party. \"I don;t know how to deal with this\", he said. So the topic was just avoided. I was just avoided.\\n\\nSunday rolls around. I miss my shift for work. I loose my job. F*** it, I say. I\\'ll spend the next to days finishing my application to a grad school program I\\'ve been eying for a while. I ask for my boyfriend\\'s help last night as I:m trying to finish my application in time for the deadline. \"I\\'m really tired\", he says. He passes out at the bottom of the bed...\\n\\nAfter staying up late I woke up early this morning to finish my work. He work up to. Apologizing for falling asleep early he offered his help. Great!, I said, I get to work as I try to come up with something for him to help with. When he gets up to take a show an hour later I notice a bunch of porn pulled up on his computer. I hit the roof. I\\'m sitting right next to him and he\\'s looking at porn?! When I\\'m on pain killers? After having an abortion that I never even wanted to have in the first place? Go fuck yourself, I said. His response? I\"Ve always looked at porn, even while we were dating. I\\'m sorry. I was really horny and didn\\'t want to bother you while you were working... Porn is a natural thing to look at blah blah blah. It\\'s 9 p.m. now. I\\'m sitting on the couch waiting for him to come home from a business dinner and I\\'m still livid. More than livid, I\\'m crushed. How could anyone be so inconsiderate?? How could someone who you LOVE be so inconsiderate, so hurtful? I feel about six inches tall. Bad analogy. I feel invisible.\\n\\nI feel very detached from everything right now. Even this post seems passive to me. In all honestly, I\\'m so hurt I think I may be in shock. I\\'m so sad and know that I should be in therapy. But oh yeah: did I mention I not longer have health care. There\\'s that, too.\\n'\n",

            " b'Need Help Urgently [long read]Everything i write here is of complete honesty, i will not hold anything back.\\n\\ni can not find any purpose to live in the working world.\\n\\nI just turned 20 years old ago a few months ago and i need some insight or suggestions on how to live that is desired and not the destined, cookie cutter life.\\n\\nMy philosophy on life is to live life to its fullest and work too the minimal degree, preferably not at all if you can afford it, the way that the working/labor force is set up does not fit to human nature in many ways, whether it be spiritually, mentally or physically, i will also say i am by now means lazy, i just like many others my age and even older believe that the way the current workforce as well as education system is set up has to much stacked against the modern day human being, and is idealistic to the past not the present.\\n\\nThe issue is in today\\'s world working 2-3 jobs is becoming the norm just for people trying to scrape by and afford basic necessities and shelter. For example there is 168 hours in a week, lets say a person works 60 hours MINIMUM a week, so their we have 108 hours left, with the MINIMUM amount of sleep needed (lets say 6 hours for 5 days) a person would have 30hours dedicated to just that, leaving 78 hours left, combine 5 days worth of communicating as well as getting ready/washing up before and after work that leaves a person 60.5 hours to do their own thing in a week, and that does not account for chores in daily life/gym time etc. as well as being actually to tied to enjoy this time off.\\n\\nThe next problem with working this amount of time is even after all the effort put in, the majority of people still fall behind on bills and necessities creating a rut where they essentially get trapped in the work they are doing, never really getting ahead.\\n\\nNow i am not going to get to far into the issues with this system that is set up, but i am sure that most people today already know what i am talking about.\\n\\npeople are not praised for the most of their early lives in school are not praised for creative and artistic abilities, rather how quick and efficiently standardized tests can be complete, while people with individualists ideas are often overlooked, left behind or shot down, it often makes me wonder just how many people considered \"smart\" are not so smart but just very good at memorization and test taking, intelligence, like people in general come in all forms.\\n\\nso that brings it back to me personally.\\n\\ni guess you could think of me as one of those \"aimless\" people that went into adulthood, i am 20, dropped out of college like so many others because they seen no real future in their program and ended up with an unrealistic debt and a shitty call center job full of other lost souls to try and make it in the world.\\n\\ni have been stuck in a cycle of being stuck anywhere between 800$-200$ in my overdraft for probably the last year or so, its not like i waste my money either, this is literally from paying off bills/car insurance and absolute necessities, and this is with working 42.5 hours MINIMUM usually more.\\n\\nI still live with my parents out of absolute need, i hate it everyday and feel like a fucking leach, but i have no other option and can not seem to get ahead.\\n\\nEven at my current job, i can not motivate myself to work to my fullest potential, your job performance is measured in satisfaction stats for uncaring and ungrateful customers and regardless of how much effort you put in, you can still get poor surveys and the blame falls on you, it is just not worth it to put all of yourself into such a fickle environment in my opinion. In all honesty as soon as i quit/get fired from my current job i do not see my self getting a real \"job\" for a long time if ever again.\\n\\npeople often try to tell me that getting into a trade is the only real opportunity i have with my life, i always reply that i would be miserable and that no amount of money is worth trading your happiness away.\\n\\nwhat i really aspire to do at this part of my life, is to travel around freely with no obligations, going from place to place, seeing all the different sights and meeting all the different people, living life to its fullest and not having regrets in the future about wasting my entire life away working, having a steady income coming in from non-working ventures, such as investments or on the road opportunities, no handouts or government assistantince, i do not go for such entitlement.\\n\\nI have been educating myself in binary options for quite some time but have not invested into yet, i want to be as ready as i can be before i do that but i have thought about that for a potential-sole income in the future.\\n\\nIt is getting to the point where i see really no purpose in living and going on in life if this is \"the real world\", i have completed suicide many, many times before and with each passing week i am getting that much closer, i have even set a date in January if things do not start going my way, i have no fear of death.\\n\\nI really don\\'t care what is said about me and the judgement that is passed by people here, if you can truly feel happy and enjoy life working the majority of you\\'re free time away, usually making someone else who has barley/never worked richer, than all the power too you, its not for me, it is not healthy and i don\\'t believe it is even compatible it today\\'s world of free thinkers and opportunists.\\n\\nso my question is to you fine people of reddit, what recommendations would you give to live the type of life i have described above with very little to no money at the moment?\\n\\nHypothetically if i were to just get in my car and decide to drive to a different part of Canada one day what would be the best way to sustain? If it did come down to this i would likely stop paying off my student loan and maybe even my car insurance for an amount of time to try to save as much as cash as possible.\\n\\nSo redditer\\'s that have been in or are in this situation please give me some advice or tips that do not fall along the lines of staying in my current situation, because the current situation is only going to lead to eventual death very soon and any directions made to \"work through it\" or \"live in the real word\" will only add coal to the fire.\\n\\nIt has never been about the money to me, only the experience\\n\\n\"If I Can\\'t Be My Own...

            " b\"If I could escape, I could see myself happy in a different lifeI used to think that I was trapped in this sort of life because I ended up in so many bad situations in my life.  Seemed like I had some sort of curse.  Thought there was something about me that would make bad always follow me.\\n\\nI'm finally starting to accept that that isn't true.  I've just seen so much bad that I could never believe or imagine the good.  I know there's nothing wrong with me, that I can be loved, accepted, and respected.  I've just managed to always be around people who never loved, accepted or respected me by ill-luck (nothing to do with me).  If I was somewhere else, I could have a happy life.  Or at least it's easier to imagine it now.  But, I'm currently living with abusive people.  I wish I could just fly away, get out of here and go to that place in my mind.  But I can't.  No money, no car, nowhere to live.  I have a fragile body and can't just live on the street or on couches, though I don't mind damaging myself if i had to do it temporarily, knowing that I could find a happy place.  But I just don't have that much faith.  Most people aren't happy, it seems.  People just complain and put on fake cheer.  Why should I think I can be luckier?\\n\\nI wish I had money, friends, fun, joy.  I wish I wasn't surrounded by people who are always trying to undermine me.  Sounds simple but feels impossible.  I'm stuck here and don't know if it will ever end.  This soul-sucking life goes on for eternity, day after day.\"\n",

The first few times I asked for help I told my parent I was depressed. This was when I was barely a teenager, and she just did the normal parent thing of saying, \"What do you have to be depressed about?\" \\n\\nThen, a few years later I started self-harming and not attending school. My school made me see a psychologist (for low attendance) but they said I was fine. My Mother told them about my self harming, which I\\'m sure they already knew about if and this psychologist said it\\'s just trendy and that her son does it because he\\'s a Goth. Those words makes me cringe to this day. My Mother took me to my GP anyway and they refused me to refer me to any mental health service and gave me a leaflet for a mental health service of which I was not within the age range. I later dropped out of school.\\n\\nI started drinking to deal with it, then having strange symptoms (derealisation/depersonalisation). I was having panic attacks multiple times everyday and completely socially isolates myself for a few years. I felt terrible all the time and was deeply disturbed by my thoughts.\\n\\nWhen things got a little better I decided to go back to school as I had no qualifications and went on to study a course which could get me into University studying a science related degree. I found the work stupidly easy and went through with good grades. By the time I was on my last year my mental health was deteriorating quickly, I could no longer concentrate or function at school or in any other area of my life. I went to my GP and they asked me some irrelevant questions about my Father, none about my symptoms apart from weight loss/gain and sleep. Then refused to give me SSRI\\'s. \\n\\nI went home and some time later, my memory is a blur, I tried to kill myself. I\\'ve now had two serious attempts at taking my life and I\\'m positive there\\'s no way for me to get help, but if I don\\'t get help soon I know I\\'m going to try again. And I know it will likely work this time. I\\'ve tried to get help so many times, I can\\'t even leave my house anymore. I don\\'t know what to do. Nobody is taking me seriously and I have no idea what\\'s wrong with me. How can I get help? I\\'ve even tried reaching out to people working in the NHS. Nothing comes of it. I have people who depend on me and I don\\'t want to put my potential to waste but I\\'m running out of time and I\\'ve tried everything I can. I don\\'t even have the emotional energy anymore. \\n\\nI\\'m not scared of dying and the idea is quite appealing to me regardless of my mental state, so if it happens it happens. I have multiple mental health problems as well as sensory processing problems relating to a neurodevelopment disorder I have and just existing is torture to me. Even when my mental health is okay. I want the suffering to end. I\\'m so, so tired. I just need to know that I tried for the people I care about and my own philosophical reasons. And I would do anything in my power to turn this situation around. If anyone can offer any advice to me then please leave a comment. Anything you have to say will be helpful to me.\\n\\n'\n",

do i even have the right to be called such a thing? i paint myself innocent but find myself uncaring of anyone other then my lover. but im a demon with a porcelain mask, and a sexual deviant. its strange, i can accept other people deviant prefrences, but i cant even accept my own sexuality which even goes described as \"tame\" from other deviants. mabey im afraid what others think? in dont even allow others outside family to know about my homosexual side of things and even then, not all my family knows. im homophobic, afraid of sexual conatact with another person. mabey its the insults ive recieved my whole life, being called \"gay\" or a \"faggot\". it could of been my taumatic experiences that scar me today, making me question if it wasnt as bad as i tell myself. mabey it was that bad. the only real thing is the feeling of betrayal or the ignorance of the action. its late when im down, impossible to resist putting sleep off in my depressed state. i hate sleep. i love sleep. it takes my time awake, but it feels nice to slumber only made worse by my long out of control sleep cycles. alseep for 10 hours or more, awake for 14 hours or more feeling like im constantly living outside of time. i never know what day or time it is, its hard to keep track when the next day begins before i go back to sleep. when theres nothing to look forward to so i dont count the days to anything. the only things allowing me to keep track are the seasons. i even forget how old i am. why count something so useless? \"congrats! youve lived xxx amount of years! just wait till you xxx when you grow old and die!\". and thats if i somehow manage to get that far without something causing my untimely demise. id welcome it if it werent for the fact that every way i go would likely be painful if its health related, and much worse if it has to do with my living arrangement which surely wont last forever. whod want to take care of a autistic, sexual deviant, man-child? it only makes me a burden. either i end up never living with my SO and continue painfully living with my mother till she dies and then end up dying on the streets or something, or, i live with my SO causing them more stress then they deserve, more strain on them finacially while they take care of their own family on top of me. the might even kill themselves leaving me to bear the pain of losing them as well. i want them happy, but theres nothing i can do. i cant even make myself happy. though they said it in stress as i was trying to comfort them, i believe its completely true. \"what fucking good are you then?!\". it was worse to hear then my own father saying \"im leaving because of you\" before living in michigan with his girlfriend and her children while leaving me behind with my brother and sister. even with him gone, my brother replaces him while almost being just as emotionally abusive. my sister bathing in attention. at least shes not mean like she used to be, but shes never shown remorse for how she treated me. i might as well be a redheaded stepchild. now to sleep and hate myself for wasting valuable time with my SO because of my depression. and fuck thanksgiving, everyone laughingn in the living room as i remain in my room. nothing to make you feel more lonely then no one to keep you company and the only people who could are either asleep due to a different timezone or, they are spending time with people you hate or you really dont belong with them in the first place. being so different only makes spending time with people reflect how alone you are.'\n",

I'm an instagram influencer so I have enough money to get me by. I am also a scholar  at my country's top university, so I don't have to worry about how I'll pay for my tuition fee. I have a boyfriend (Yes, I am gay. That's one of the reasons why my father does not like me.) and he has his own place, so I don't have to worry about not having shelter. My father does not like my presence in this house, because they keep insisting that I changed. I used to smile a lot, but now I am mostly sulking in my room. I cry every night because I have a lot of shortcomings as a son. I'm really tired. They do not know the reason why I have suddenly changed, but I am sure it is because of my depression. My boyfriend took me to a psychiatrist a few months ago, it turns out I am depressed. I refuse to take my medicine because of its side effects. When I tried to tell my dad, he said mental illnesses are not real, so I kept it to myself. We had an argument a while ago, he told me I should leave his house. The problem is that most of my money is with him. He borrowed my money when he had nothing to feed us, He owes me around 2000 USD and he is in no condition to pay me that amount right now, which is why I am having second thoughts of pushing through. \\n\\nI love my parents, I would never replace them even if I had the chance to do so. However, I do wish that they would open their minds (and possible their hearts). They seem to measure love through the amount of things that they can give. They were able to give me most of the things I asked them for, but they were not able to give me the love that I need to be able to get through ny problems. There are times wherein I resorted to self harm, because I can't take the emotional pain. My heart would hurt so bad. Last week, I cried myself to sleep. I cried so hard, I tried to keep quiet, but the words won't stop coming out of my mouth. I was crying for help, because the pain was so much. I ever prayed for help, but nothing happened. It was one of the worst breakdowns I had, I felt like my heart was about to pop. \\n\\nSorry for the unorganized ideas, but to sum things up:\\n1. My father told me to leave the house during an argument. Do you think I'll be able to make it? (Considering the factors above)\\n\\n2. I'm gay. It's not a choice, but they do not understand that. If it was a choice, I'd rather be straight. Things would be so much easier as a straight man. \\n\\n3. I'm depressed, but my family doesn't know.

Hate my life, hate my country, hate stay alone.\\n\\nI just broke up, my job is bad and I am individuated for the next 10 years. it kills me inside and I can't take it anymore. I wanted to live the world, be happy ... but I can't succeed in anything. Why?? Some reason to continue? \\n\\nSorry about my English\"\n",

Understandably I also  am in your shoes and I have a wife and two daughters neither even two years old. To be honest it is all a scheme to bring in their NWO. For those ignorant to the end game of the elite they want to remove 90% of the worlds population in order to more easily control the masses and corral  them into their NWA (new world agend). It disgusts me that this world would rather take the word of a liar and lazy fuck than an honest and hard finger to the bone worker. I have always had the work ethic of a African slave I bust my ass and push myself literally to the point of passing out and get afterwords and I keep going. I don't believe in quitting yet what have I received in return...not a damn thing. Often I have contemplated suicide, I've sold drugs to my own shame done things to get money to support my family I never imagined I was capable of. The truth is the government doesn't give a royal fuck about you and neither does anyone else because everyone anymore cares only for self so any chance of advancement is out of the damn picture. What I can say is don't give up on yourselves,I won't  and only say this because I don't have that option I'd kill someone else before I did myself if it came down to it. It may be terrible to say but it is the fault of those in Washington D.C. who don't give a fuck about the people they are supposed to represent. Good luck my fellow unemployed brothers and sisters of humanity. Remember color matters not neither does status or privilege yet the truest measure of a person is their character even if it is unappreciated by others.\"\n",
